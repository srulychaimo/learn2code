============================
> A small basic react & node.js project.


Features
============================

- A website that u can see lecturers for programing lanuages.
- Filter the lecturers by language.
- Full responsiveness.

Note
============================

I have chosen to make the functionality of filtering by the frontend, 
Because I didn't want to load the server.
